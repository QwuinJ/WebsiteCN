            <h2>Creative and Voluntary Work and Personal Interests</h2>
            <h4>Poetry Performance</h4>
            <p>From 2016-18 I was an organiser and regular performer at Spokes Open Mic night in Cornwall. I performed as Susan Biscuits, a drag act (pictured opposite). Recordings of my poetry to be uploaded later. During this time I learned many valuable skills including organising, team working, and performance skills.</p>
            <h4>Turn Around Bin Rat</h4>
            <p>In 2020, I joined Turn Around Bin Rat (TABR), a start-up with the aims of providing quality poetry education for all. Over the past year, I have worked to design a brand and style guide, a website, and helped with the larger organisational aims.</p>
            <h4>Voluntary Work</h4>
            <p>Since 2012, I have been involved with voluntary work for various organisations. This has included running book clubs at local libraries, working as an assistant leader at Guides groups, and running societies at univeristy. Recently, I have been offering no-cost admin assistance for local co-operative groups in Manchester, primarily with The Burrow Housing Co-op.</p>
            <h4>Other Interests</h4>
            <p>For the past four years I have worked at festivals as a voluntary steward, including Glastonbury, Isle of Wight Festival, and End of the Road Festival. This has been both excellent fun, and taught me valuable communication and crowd control skills.<br><br>I have a variety of hobbies, including star-gazing, DIY, embroidery, and circus skills. I am a keen walker, and enjoy birdwatching.</p>
